	 * time.

	 * engine mode to process them for (lazy loading).
	 *
	 * @param $connection_name a string representing the string of the connection we want to deal with
	 * @param $engine_mode an integer constant referenced from ConnectionManager for the engine mode we're in
	 *
	 * @throws eGlooDPDefinitionParserException if attempting to construct a second instance of this class
