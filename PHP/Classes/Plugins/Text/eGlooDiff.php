		Paul's Simple Diff Algorithm v 0.1
		(C) Paul Butler 2007 <http://www.paulbutler.org/>
		May be used and distributed under the zlib/libpng license.

		This code is intended for learning purposes; it was written with short
		code taking priority over performance. It could be used in a practical
		application, but there are a few ways it could be optimized.

		Given two arrays, the function diff will return an array of the changes.
		I won't describe the format of the array, but it will be obvious
		if you use print_r() on the result of a diff on some test data.

		htmlDiff is a wrapper for the diff command, it takes two strings and
		returns the differences in HTML. The tags used are <ins> and <del>,
		which can easily be styled with CSS.
