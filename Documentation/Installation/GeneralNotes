Known issue: eGloo expects Smarty and Doctrine to be installed and able to be found by locate.  This is a bug, but
you should know to have them already in the PHP path somewhere and run sudo updatedb before running the eGloo installer.

After downloading eglooframework:

tar -zxvf eglooframework-1dp1.tar.gz
cd eglooframework-1dp1/Build
sudo ./Install.sh

*** Follow all instructions in installer ***

To see how to make an eGloo application, please refer to Skeleton.app in the eGloo application directory (set during install)

The webroot that is setup during install contains several files:

index.php (eGloo Bootloader)
PHP -> eglooframework/PHP (Symlink)
Config.xml (Local Configuration Options)
System.xml (eGloo System Configuration Information - DO NOT MODIFY)
.htaccess (Environment variables and DB connection settings)

eGloo Installer is "non-destructive".  If your webroot gets hosed, you can rerun the installer and it will not delete any
files/symlinks currently set.  It will move your old .htaccess file to .htaccess-{timestamp}.

Important directories:

Configuration Cache: /var/tmp/com.egloo.cache/
Template Cache: /var/cache/egloo/{Application.app} (Exact directory OS-dependent, check System.xml for specific path)

Hot-caching of CSS, XCSS, JS, XJS and Images happens in the webroot dynamically.  These directories can be safely deleted to
clear static cache and eGloo will repopulate them as needed.

Finally, it is recommended that you: sudo cp ./Scripts/restartmemcache to /usr/bin/restartmemcache or /usr/local/bin/restartmemcache

eGloo, by default, expects several memcache daemons on specific ports on localhost to be made available if memcache is used.
These can be changed by editing eglooframework/PHP/Classes/Performance/Caching/Deprecated/CacheGateway.php and the restartmemcache script

In exchange for rapid development and proper SE design, eGloo sacrifices speed in development mode and ability to run without caching support.

NOTE: eGloo is NOT meant to be run without the use of APC or memcached.  There are no plans to support running without a caching engine available for production.
