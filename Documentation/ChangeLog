*** Version 1.0 Developer Preview 1 ***

After 5 years of development effort, we're releasing the first developer preview of eGloo Framework

No warranty implied or expressed, APIs still in flux and things probably broken.  But we're at a
place where we'd like to start soliciting feedback from the wider development community so that we
can work to make eGloo the best PHP framework out there!

Please see our project site on http://sourceforge.net/projects/eglooframework/ to read up, submit
feedback and maybe even lend a hand.
