What is eGloo Framework?

eGloo Framework is a next-generation, peer-to-peer web development framework that merges the best practices of modern software engineering design, architecture and process with the hottest and most innovative technologies available to the web development world today.  The core of its mission is to be the development foundation and resultant network from which an implicit information exchange between independent personal websites, web services, blogs, e-commerce, social networks and gaming platforms can arise.  In short, eGloo Framework is the rapid development path to breaking down walled gardens and finally realizing a truly free and fluid information economy.
