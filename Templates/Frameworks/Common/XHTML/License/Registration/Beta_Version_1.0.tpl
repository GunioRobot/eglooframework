    WHEREAS, eGloo wishes to disclose to Participant a new version of its eGloo website and/or
    program and other confidential information for purposes of Participant's use and beta test
    evaluation for a limited period of time. The Parties wish to provide for the conditions of
    such disclosure and use. NOW THEREFORE, the Parties agree:
</p>

<p>
    1. As used in this Agreement, the term "Software," "Website," "Product," "Program,"
    "Prototype," "Build," "Beta," or "Version," shall mean access to a beta version of the
    eGloo website and related software and websites and any non-public versions of associated
    third party products as well as any accompanying manuals and written documentation. The
    term "Confidential Information" shall mean any information or data disclosed by eGloo to 
    Participant, either in writing or orally, and including without limitation any written or 
    printed documents, digital media, websites, samples, software, models, standalone beta 
    versions or any means of disclosing such Confidential Information that eGloo may elect to 
    use.
</p>

<p>
    2. You hereby acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information
    could cause irreparable harm and significant injury to eGloo that may be difficult to 
    ascertain. Accordingly, you agree that eGloo will have the right to obtain immediate 
    injunctive relief to enforce obligations under this Agreement in addition to any other 
    rights and remedies it may have. 
</p>

<p>
    3. eGloo hereby grants Participant a limited-term, non-exclusive, non-transferable 
    royalty-free license to use the Website for purposes of evaluation and trial only. Upon
    completion of the evaluation of the Website, Participant shall return any and all 
    accompanying Confidential Information to eGloo. Participant hereby covenants that it will
    not: a. modify, adapt, reproduce, transfer the Website or accompanying Confidential 
    Information; b. permit other companies or individuals to use the Website or accompanying 
    Confidential Information; c. modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble
    (except to the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction), or create

    assign, or otherwise transfer rights to the Website or accompanying Confidential 
    Information; or e. remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Website or 
    accompanying Confidential Information.

</p>

<p>
    5. Security Precautions: Tester shall take reasonable security precautions to prevent the 
    Website from being seen by unauthorized individuals. This includes locking all copies of
    Confidental Information and associated documentation in a desk or file cabinet when not in
    use, as well as logging out of any and all eGloo accounts when not in use.
</p>

<p>
    6. Participant may use the Website on any single computer; use the Website on a second 
    computer so long as the primary user of the Website is the same person and more than one 
    copy of an account is not used simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
    7. Tester's Obligations: Tester shall test the Website under normally expected operating 
    conditions in Tester's environment during the test period. Tester shall gather and report 
    test data as mutually agreed upon with the Company.
</p>

<p>
    8. Participant agrees to provide reasonable feedback with respect to Product evaluations, 
    including without limitation reasonable feedback on usability, bug reports, test results 
    and documentation (collectively "Feedback"). Participant will develop a test sample and 
    either send paper samples with comments to eGloo or, where appropriate, send 
    machine-readable files as test samples. Participant grants to eGloo a non-exclusive,
    worldwide, royalty-free right and license to reproduce, distribute, make derivative works 
    based upon, publicly display, publicly perform, make, use, sell, and export the Feedback or
    the content produced by the Participant as incorporated within eGloo products and services,
    including without limitation the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of
    sub licensees. Participants will be given a venue through which they can petition for
    ownership of certain pieces of user-created material.

    or about the accuracy of data or information made accessible by it. eGloo provides the
    Website to Participant "as is" without express or implied warranties, including but not
    limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose or
    noninfringement of intellectual property rights of third persons. eGloo assumes no 
    liability for any damages (whether direct, incidental or consequential) suffered by 
    Participant or any third person as a result of use of the Website or accompanying
    Confidential Information.
</p>

    data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree
    that use of the Prototype is at your sole risk. THE PROTOTYPE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND

    COMPLETENESS, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. You acknowledge that eGloo has not promised or 
    guaranteed to you that the Prototype will be publicly announced or made available to anyone
    in the future, and that eGloo has no express or implied obligation to you to announce or

    instructions provided by eGloo. Although eGloo will try to provide an initial response to a

    makes no guarantees with respect to response time or resolution of the issue. 
</p>
 
<p>
    13. All information, software, or other materials provided by eGloo are supplied "AS IS"

    code.  eGloo retains all rights in such code. You have no right to copy, decompile, reverse
    engineer, sublicense or otherwise distribute such code, except as may be expressly provided
    in the terms and conditions accompanying the code.   
</p>
 
<p>
    15. When requesting and receiving technical support, you will not provide eGloo with any 
    information, including that incorporated in your software, that is confidential to you or 
    any third party. Any notice, legend, or label to the contrary contained in any materials
    provided by you to eGloo shall be without effect. eGloo shall be free to use all 
    information it receives from you in any manner it deems appropriate. 
</p>
 
<p>
    16. eGloo reserves the right to reject a request for service at any time and for any

<p>
    17. You shall be solely responsible for any restoration of lost or altered files, data or 
    programs. 
</p>

<p>
    18. Without limitation of the scope of preceding Paragraph 4, and to the extent allowed by
    law, under no circumstances and under no legal theory, tort, contract, or otherwise, shall
    eGloo or its suppliers or resellers be liable to Participant or any other person for any
    indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without
    limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, 
    or any and all other commercial damages or losses. In no event will eGloo be liable for any
    damages in excess of eGloo's list price for a license to the Website, even if eGloo shall
    have been informed of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by any other party.
</p>

<p>
    19. Participant hereby covenants that, for a period of five (8) years from the effective 
    date of the Agreement, the Website and any Confidential Information received from eGloo 
    shall: a. be protected and kept in strict confidence by Participant, which must use the 
    same degree of precaution and safeguards as it uses to protect its own confidential
    information, but in no case any less than reasonable care; b. be only disclosed to and used
    by those persons within Participant's organization who have a need to know and solely for
    the purpose specified in this Agreement; c. not be used in whole or in part for any
    commercial purpose without the prior written consent of -- and compensation to -- eGloo. 
    "Use" shall mean conscious consideration and deliberate implementation of the Website or
    Confidential Information. "Commercial purpose" shall mean the incorporation of the Website
    or Confidential Information into products or product concepts which are offered for sale or
    license, or otherwise exploited; d. neither be disclosed nor caused to be disclosed
    (whether directly or indirectly) to any third party or persons other than those mentioned
    in Subparagraph (b) above; and e. neither be copied, nor otherwise reproduced or duplicated
    in whole or in part, where such copying, reproduction or duplication has not been
    specifically authorized in writing by the disclosing Party.
</p>

<p>
    20. Participant shall have no obligations or restrictions with respect to any Confidential
    Information which Participant can prove: a. has come into the public domain prior to or
    after the disclosure thereof, through no wrongful act of Participant; b. is already known
    to Participant, as evidenced by written documentation in the files of the receiving Party;
    c. has been lawfully received from a third party without breach of this Agreement; d. has
    been or is published without violation of this Agreement; e. is independently developed in
    good faith by employees of Participant who did not have access to the Confidential
    Information; or f. is approved for release or use by written authorization of eGloo.
</p>

<p>
    21. Tester understands and acknowledges that the Website is provided for its own use for
    testing purposes only. It is expressly understood and agreed by the Parties hereto that the
    disclosure and provision of the Website and any Confidential Information under this
    Agreement by eGloo to Participant shall not be construed as granting to Participant any
    rights, title, or interest in the Website or the Company's trade secrets to Tester whether
    express or implied by license or otherwise on the matters, inventions or discoveries to
    which such Website and Confidential Information pertains or any patent, copyright,
    trademark or trade secret rights. The property in all Confidential information disclosed by
    eGloo to Participant shall, subject to any right of any other owner, rest with eGloo.
    Title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Website shall
    remain in eGloo and/or its suppliers. Tester may not sell or transfer any portion of the
    Website to any third party or use the Website in any manner to produce, market or support
    its own products. Tester shall clearly identify the Website as the Company's property.
</p>

<p>
    22. This Agreement is personal to Tester. Tester shall not assign or otherwise transfer any
    rights or obligations in whole or in part under this Agreement. 
</p>

<p>
    23. eGloo has no obligation to issue any updates, revisions, corrections, new versions or
    manuals for the Website or otherwise to support the Website. eGloo reserves the right at
    any time to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing
    terms, terms of use, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of the
    Website.
</p>

<p>
    24. Nothing in this Agreement may be construed as compelling eGloo to disclose any
    Confidential Information to Participant or as compelling the Parties to enter into any
    contractual relationships on the basis of such disclosed Confidential Information.
</p>

<p>
    25. Termination of this Agreement may be effected by the Participant upon thirty (30) days
    prior written notice to eGloo with returned acknowledgement from eGloo. Accepted
    termination of this Agreement shall not relieve Participant from complying with the
    obligations imposed by Paragraph 19 hereof with respect to the use and protection of
    Confidential Information received prior to the date of the termination of this Agreement.
    Such obligations shall continue for the period applicable as set forth in said Paragraph.
    Upon termination of this Agreement, any possible aspects of the Website and all
    Confidential Information shall be returned to eGloo. eGloo may terminate this agreement at
    any time without prior written notice.
</p>

<p>
    26. The execution, existence and performance of this Agreement shall be kept confidential
    by the Parties hereto and shall not be disclosed by either Party without the prior written
    consent of the other.
</p>

<p>
    27. This Agreement shall be governed by and shall be interpreted in accordance with the
    laws of the state of Maryland (excluding its choice of law provisions) except that eGloo
    may enforce its intellectual property rights before the competent courts of any
    jurisdiction where an act of infringement has occurred.
</p>

<p>
    28. Failure by either Party to enforce any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be
    taken as or deemed to be a waiver of such. No waiver or amendment of any provisions of this
    Agreement shall be valid or binding against either Party unless the waiver or amendment is
    made in writing and signed by the duly appointed representatives of both Parties.
</p>

<p>
    29. The foregoing constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
    subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels all prior representations, negotiations, 
    commitments, undertakings, Systems whether oral or written, acceptances, understandings and
    agreements between the Parties with respect to or in connection with any of the matters or
    things to which such agreement applies or refers.
