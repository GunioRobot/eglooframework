--********* DOES NOT COMPILE DO NOT USE YET WORK IN PROGRESS *************

-- Domains or types for Table IDs 
-- Seequences for domains
-- Constraint functions
-- Standard Meta Data
-- Sequences for IDs
-- MODIFIED BY to a nother table?
-- Hashes for passwords and security questions or row based encryption through the db?
-- Eventually include address validation via USPS, they provide tables I believe
-- Make address more robust, multiple countries with country based address verification

-- Additional Constraints: 	created date not in the future, modified date not in the future
--							Hashes need checks to ensure that they contain the proper types of characters
--							Not Null constraint for created timestamp?

-- Conventions: make explicite constraints.
--				Null values should mean data is missing not that data has not been enetered (need to think about modified date)
--				Table names should be plurals, make the names descriptive as possible so that laymen can understand them.

-- To implement: Product Options as opposed to product sizes.  Allow for multiple variations on products, e.g. Color and size.  Allow for hierarchy within options
--					Shipping weight as two data types, actual weight as manufacturer determined in whatever units they used and lbs for shipping calculation.
--					Zones for warehouses, discuss examples.
--					Multiple shipping providers
--					Recuring coupons
--					Designation between manufacturer and selling coupons
--					Discounts and discount priority (additive, stackable, hierarchichal)
--					Domains for non sequence based identification?
